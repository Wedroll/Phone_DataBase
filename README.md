The project was carried out as laboratory work at the university. Written in Android Studio Java. The essence of the project is the creation of a database into which you can add new brands of phones with parameters (the database can also be edited and deleted). In addition, various functions have been added, for example swipes that allow you to either delete or edit an element and so on. The output of the database is implemented thanks to Recycler View.
